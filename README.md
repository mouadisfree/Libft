*My first C library project*
---
## What is this?
**Libft** is a collection of useful C functions that I wrote myself. It's a school project that helps me learn how to code in C and understand how computers work. I'll use this library in other projects later.

---

## Functions I Built

### Standard C Functions
- **Text**: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strjoin`
- **Memory**: `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`
- **Letters/Numbers**: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_tolower`

### Extra Functions
- **Text Tools**: `ft_substr`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`
- **Numbers**: `ft_itoa`
- **Memory**: `ft_calloc`

### List Functions
- `ft_lstnew`: Make new list item
- `ft_lstadd_front`: Add to front
- `ft_lstiter`: Do something to each item

## How to use it

### What you need
To use this library, you need:
- A C compiler (like `gcc`) to turn code into programs.
- A computer with Linux or macOS.

### How to set it up
1. Download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mouadisfree/Libft.git
   cd Libft


2. Build the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This makes a file called `libft.a` that contains all my functions.

## Who made this
Made by **mouadisfree** as a student at **1337 School** (part of the 42 coding schools).

## Thanks
Thanks to 1337 School and all my peers who helped me learn!
