# Libft - My C Library
![Libft Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c37a59df-3dd9-4503-b97f-ff24cd1a8206)
*My first C library project*
---
## What is this?
**Libft** is a collection of useful C functions that I wrote myself. It's a school project that helps me learn how to code in C and understand how computers work. I'll use this library in other projects later.

---

## Functions I Built
- I made my own versions of basic C functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `memcpy`.
- I added extra helpful functions for text and memory.
- I made functions for linked lists (lists that can grow).
- The code follows school style rules.

---

## All Functions

### Standard Functions
Basic C functions I remade:
- **Text**: `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strjoin`
- **Memory**: `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`
- **Letters/Numbers**: `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_tolower`

### Extra Functions
Helpful extras I added:
- **Text Tools**: `ft_substr`, `ft_strtrim`, `ft_split`
- **Numbers**: `ft_itoa`
- **Memory**: `ft_calloc`

### List Functions
For working with lists:
- `ft_lstnew`: Make new list item
- `ft_lstadd_front`: Add to front
- `ft_lstiter`: Do something to each item

## How to use it

### What you need
To use this library, you need:
- A C compiler (like `gcc`) to turn code into programs.
- A computer with Linux or macOS.

### How to set it up
1. Download the code:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mouadisfree/Libft.git
   cd Libft


2. Build the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This makes a file called `libft.a` that contains all my functions.

---

## Who made this
Made by **mouadisfree** as a student at **1337 School** (part of the 42 coding schools).

## Thanks
Thanks to 1337 School and all my classmates who helped me learn!
